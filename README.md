**Introduction**

This perticular project is to provide knowlwdge about the responsibilities of Data Controller and Data Provider.

**What is a data controller?**

A data controller is the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. In other words, the data controller is the one who decides what data is collected, how it is used, and who it is shared with.

**What is a data processor?**

A data processor is an entity that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller. This means that the data processor does not have the authority to determine the purposes and means of processing the data.

**The responsibilities of a data controller**

The data controller has a number of responsibilities under data protection laws, including:

* Obtaining informed consent from individuals before collecting their personal data.
* Having a lawful basis for processing personal data.
* Limiting data collection and processing to what is necessary for the specific purpose.
* Implementing security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
* Being transparent about data collection practices.
* Respecting individual rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the use of their personal data.
* Safely storing and retaining data for as long as it is needed.
* Establishing data protection policies and procedures.

**The responsibilities of a data processor**

The data processor also has a number of responsibilities under data protection laws, including:

* Processing personal data only in accordance with the documented instructions provided by the data controller.
* Implementing security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
* Maintaining confidentiality of personal data.
* Cooperating with data controllers to fulfill their obligations under data protection laws.
* Maintaining records of data processing activities.
